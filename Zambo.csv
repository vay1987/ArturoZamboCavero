You were my whole being, my love, I gave it to you, the love I give you is the most beautiful woman. If the bonds that unite us will break, the existence of my being will end right now.

Esta Es Mi Tierra,"This is my land so is my Peru. Race that the world wrote to the gray history of the empire of the sun Raised flames my bicolor flag. On the mountain and mountain coast, with peace, work and love. This is my land so is my Peru. The richness of its coast in the world without equal, and the generous sierra fructifies our bread. While the mountain awaits who is going to conquer it, the pride of my race is the history of Peru. And I want this tondero with flavor of gratitude to be heard from the four winds, in the north, center and south. This is my land so is my Peru. This is my land so is my Peru. With the sincere cajonear and the guitar in hand we tell the Peruvians that we are all brothers."
